1,The camera is not up to the mark for its build. They say it has a Sony camera but the crispiness is not there once you capture it. Over all a great phone except for the camera. You can got it"
2,"Selfie camera is not up to the mark,rest is good, working softly after 1mths of use.Battery back up is of one day after normal use.Sound quality is very good,also the front camera,so good value for money."
3,"Pros:- 1. Performance is best for normal user.
2. Camera is excellent as it has sony sensor.
3. Fingerprint and display is also best as it has amoled display.
4. Sound Quality is good

Cons:- the only cons i can see that if it has 5000mah battery, it would have been more better.
Here i want to mention that don't go for negative review about battery, you have to optimise in the settings and it will easily give you 20-30 hrs of backup in single charge."
4,"Writing this review after 19 days of usage

Pro:
display is very nice and smooth
Performance is good
Look and in hand feel is awesome
Charge time is 35mins max

Cons :
battery back up is not upto the mark. Considering its 4500 mah battery, it's well optimised. But if u were using 5000 or 6000 mah battery mobile previously, please don't consider this.
There are some glitches in the mobile.
Camera quality is below average
Wide angle camera is worst

Packaging was good and delivery was on time. Thanks Amazon for delivering smiles?? order 2 more mobiles after this with same color. ??
That's all for now bye ??"

Battery life quite satisfied, can last longer up to a day with all activities like gaming, net surfing, watching videos. Over all it's fantastic phone in this price segment."

43,"Build quality is nice so feels premium in hand.
Camera is also very good. Although I am not much into megapixels and pro usage but it takes great pictures.
Front camera is also great.
Battery ?? backup is 3.5/5 but it charges from 10% to 100% within 30 mins so that kind of evens things out. Somedays I need to charge the device twice a day. I am always using social media like alwayyyyyys even when I am working ????
Screen quality is also pretty good.
What else is left?
Speakers? Loud enough and nice.
No 3.5 mm jack but nobody cares...Or do you?
Call recording notification is there ???? Buy a samsung if that's a major concern for you."

61,"Good product. But if we see Realme, oppo are softwares are same. One names are different. One plus retaining the no 1 brand should change the software giving a best dyamic look."
62,Phone comes along with bundles of features. Camera picture quality couldn't meet my expectations... So 3* for camera...
63,
64,I owned a One Plus 2 long ago which lasted several years without any issues. I purchased the Nord series thinking that it would be equally good and economical solution. I feel the Nord is a cheaper alternative which is inferior to the original equipment. Camera quality is not that great.

Camera is good both rear and front.

Attached are 1 slo-mo and 1 potrait picture."

Hope this helps to you to buy

100,Overall good package
101,Nice phone but oxygen os is now similar like colour OS and camera needs improvement as it is not detecting accurate colour of the image otherwise performance is better than other Android phone

111,"Good all around phone . Sold my s22 ultra to buy the nothing phone 1 as well as the one plus Nord 2t , but thinking of using the extra cash for something else as this phone suits my needs . Just facing an issue with the auto brightness otherwise there is no heating nothing at all.
Perfect for everyday use and I'm not much of a gamer so can't comment on that.
Cameras are decent , coming from the s22 ultra (there is no comparision) but this phone clicks decent pictures.
Will update after a month if I'm facing any issues at all ..!!"

116,Nice Product. Must Buy it.
117,"Last 25 days I am using one plus Nord 2T, my first phone one plus device, it's awesome phone do not compare other brand to one plus because price wise little bit costly but it worthable mobile for that price , only the thing is battery back up it is drained fastly, but 80wattts supervocc charger it will charge Up to 25 minutes 0 to 100 it's really awesome ?? even Samsung and oppo they never ever given fast charging , other all Ihave to give 5 star this device , and even sound quality is very good for music lovers, must buy if really like one plus device"

121,All over good
122,"Fingerprint reader best, better is not so best it's average camera good"
123,All Rounder But Little Disappointed with Battery Optimisation
124,"If you are looking for a 'good-for-everything, and not the best in specific arena' phone, this is it. Well balanced in performance vs price and reliable in all aspects, won't let you down."
125,Overall good phone..i like it...
126,"The phone is nice , but not good enough for its value.
The os syttem is clean ,fast refresh rate , even regular ussage at 90z doesn't allow to spent whole day , as battery drops very fast, high drainage of battery,
And damm i was not expecting cameras and pics quality to be so poor for the price range,
Although it gives premium quality feel, but not on gaming aspects, moment u starts playing it reaches instantly upto 40°c which reduces gaming experience, and damm i regret choosing MTK processor phone."
127,"Looks very nice,
feel premium ,
comfortable to hold in hand ,
wonderful bettery backup last for a day in normal uses.
Camera quality is also good.
Haptics are very good.
Overall nice Mobile to buy in this price range."
128,
129,Its ok phone at this price. For Day to Day use its perfect. Go for it.
130,A good product
131,"Things to consider if u r looking for it

1. 90hz is very smooth in this phone - except Youtube - in every app you will see highr refresh rate UNLIKE iqoo where you will not see higher refresh rate anywhere except homescreen .

2. heating issue - due to glass back every machine heats up - i have ip 11 and comparing to that this heats like NOTHING - so no heating ISSUES per se

3. I think proximity sensor is not accurate but only sometimes , and also it feels like sometimes sound from earpiece is a little less

4. games work like charm - although it is not for gamers - but it does a great job if you play for 2-3 hours daily

5. Front camera feels like 2 MP when taking the shot - but is actually a very capable camera sensor is provided - if you use Gcam just for front - you will see that the selfies are litreally like PIXEL 6 Pro ( I know this is a big claim ) and back main sensor is LEGIT OP !

6. Haptic feedback in my phone is really charming - very good - you will surely feel like holding a really premium phone for sure

7. Ofcourse one of my main reason to buy this phone was good OS and built quality and despite bad OxygenOS reputation - It in reality is way too good than its competitors.

Be wise with your purchase DONT go blindly by the specs . thanks ."
132,Phone is heating more
133,
134,Phone is good but software is too bad.
135,
136,Nice Camera
137,Good
138,The phone is amazing but the delivery was too late i have to wait a lot and the offers were also not that good
139,I found its touch not as smooth as what One Plus is known for but overall a great phone.
140,Do phone comes without seal..?
141,Camera quality good and battery life average
142,OnePlus brand always standout with there quality. One of the best phone under 30k. Battery life could have been better. Camera is good. Very sturdy build.
143,Overall good.
144,"The phone is really handy it gives a premium feel in hand and is really good for people who has a normal usage of phone which will last for a days use.
If you are a gamer with heavy usage of phone the phones battery life might not last long enough for a day as battery draining is found a little faster.
Camera quality is great, phone is fast no excessive heating issues were found."
145,phone is ok but delivery man is not good
146,"I have been using this device for two weeks..overall good...battery capacity is excellent..design ,color,sound quality is very good. The minus point is Mute option in status bar removed..camera is good.one plus should definately work on screen brightness cause it's low compared to other devices. Processor is very good. A little bit high prize. And this device deserves 120 hz at this price range."
147,Good product
148,
149,"Pros:
1) charging:
80w fast charging
2) OS:
OnePlus feel with the oxygen OS which might change as color os in the future????
3) Audio:
The speakers are pretty good and loud

Cons:
1) front camera:
Just to let you know the front 32mp camera is the worst I have ever seen it brings the red tan on our face which is not good to look at.
2)processor:
The processor dimensity 1300 is pretty bad when compared to snapdragon 870 which is provided by its competitors like iqoo Neo 6, poco F4 etc.
3)Battery:
It does provide a 80w fast charging but the 4500mah battery lets you drain the battery faster as well.
4)Display:
It only provides 90hz refresh rate and at this price point it should have been 120hz.

The only reason someone would buy this is because of the name OnePlus but I think the competitors like iqoo neo6 and poco F4 are much better in terms of value"
150,"I think ifany phone except ""Iphone"" people will not be satisfied with the performance. I believe it's how you use it and in case you come across any problem just get it checked through service center. No phone reviews will give you all the happy customers. If your budget suits then go ahead as for me this phone is good. You can try your luck??"

160,The phone got heated initially while setting up. But did not face any issues after that. Battery life is really poor. Could have been much better at this price range. Even after I optimized most of the things it lasts only for 10hrs with minimum usage while advertising for 24hrs....

I dislike about it is refresh rate can be a bit higher.

Now most of the smartphones come with 5000-6000 mah in this price but this comes with 4500 mah, need to see how is the battery durability on continues using it."

204,"Good display and performance, smooth. Just okay battery and pretty average camera."
205,There is heating problem in phone.
206,Value for money
207,"Pros :
- Great display. Smooth (a pleasant 90Hz refresh rate), colors pop out really well, and the HDR definitely adds the extra edge (pun intended).
- Premium in-hand feel. The phone feels great in the hand, and has the vibe of a higher end flagship device. well constructed body.
- The speakers are clear and well balanced considering phone speakers in general.
- The 80Watt VOOC charging is a blessing. The phone charges from zero to 100 in about 35-40 minutes.
- Overall, a great purchase in this budget, I believe the One Plus Nord 2T to be the best smartphone in this price range.

Cons :
- The battery drains out very quickly.
- The phone heats up a bit when using constantly for some time.
- The Camera is not really great as I expected it to be, the AI camera mode makes the images blurry and over processed, due to some noise reduction algorithm.
- The camera module in the back looks very pooly designed. The are three cameras, but the way it's designed it almost looks like there's 4 cameras. Also, the low res depth sensor feels particularly useless, instead of that, they could just have two camera, one ultra wide and one 35/50mm."
208,Back camra is awesome
209,Overall good
210,Mobile is nice but front camera is not clear and everything is nice battery is good

 Orderd very first day.... Good experience so far..
Pros:
screen is much soothing and features are exact as expected... Initially I was not satisfied with the cameras (But went deep dived into the features)... Now, my simple answer is ?????? and it will take hardly 35 mins to charge...

Cons:
Phone is bit heating
Camera design should be much more good (though it won't disappoint you!)

Verdict: people who are searching phone under 30k.. u can go ahead with this phone"
215,Battery capacity is very low. Stay only 15to20hr.... Camera is good but not up to the mark.... Very dissatisfied ??

224,"Great device if you're opting for OnePlus budget range smartphones, better than multiple phones in this price segment. This is my 15 days usage review."
225,"Go and buy without second thought.

better buy Oneplus branded phones instead of buying cheap phones like realme,IQOO,OPPO

Initally i was using realme phone and it has lot of bloatware and when we speak on phone call, ear gets heat and i am not noticed that in Oneplus.

Screen is excellent when you compare any amoled display in all other brands.

especailly UI Is excellent and no lag in that while accessing applications.

Sound is so great in earphone as well inbuilt speaker.

Phone is so premium and so light weight when you keep in hand and it so handy.

Charging to 100% is taking 25-30 mins.. i have not noticed any heat

especailly Oneplus sans font is really good and it is feel like IOS font.

Cons :

battery is slightly draining , that is ignorable since it has fast charging .

Final Verdict: Whoever need branded phone with all features go without second thought."

231,"Loved the battery back up of OnePlus & the night camera it's just awesome ?? in both the indoor & outdoor conditions. Looks Premium Good Performance soo far, it's 90hz refresh rate but feels 120hz flowing touch , so far so good Loved Very much ????????"
232,"All functionalities are good except for battery it's draining fast not as expected other than that it's smooth, it does charge fast in max 20-25 mins, also it's not getting heated and camera is also good."
233,"The name OnePlus itself is enough to review..!!
Review after using for a week.

Pros:
Great camera: Tested in rainy and foggy atmosphere, night time and in bright sunlight too.
Amazing charging time : 0-100% in 30 Mins Sharp. (I experimented myself)
Attractive body and color: The Jade blue is amazing color.
Technical Specifications: All the specs are great in such price of 27500 INR"
234,There is heating problem with this Mobile and battery drains faster than my other Mobile which has the same 4500mAh Lithium-ion battery. It works no better than a 8gb ram gb mobile . Overall it is a disappointment .
235,I don't dislike but I disappointed a little after using this phone because this phone does not support external mic for which I bought this phone. For only this thing I would like to give only 3 star.
236,"1- Facing issues with Instagram also, unable to load it you have to close the app then open again.
2- Camera is so awesome and low light best camera
3-Battery and charging is so fast 30 min full charge."
237,
238,"Phone is good quality but after using 5 days i feel its lagging while watching cricket match in sony and its hanged once then i restarted mobile,rest overall good."
239,"If you're looking for a phone under 30k primarily for content consumption then one plus Nord 2t is definitely one of the best options in its segment.

DISPLAY - Absolutely in love with the smooth 90hz amoled display, colours are bright and vivid. The display coupled with its kick-ass set of speakers makes it a delight to watch high quality content on OTT platforms and YouTube.

BATTERY & CHARGING - Comes with a 80w fast charger that charges the battery to 100% in less than 30 minutes and lasts a full day even with heavy usage.

When in hurry, simply charge it for 10 minutes and you're good to go for the next 4-5 hours.

GAMING - I am not much of a gamer but from what i have seen, it handles gaming pretty well without any issues.

HEATING - I was quite sceptical before buying Nord 2T given the notorious performance of its predecessor in this particular department. But looks like they have improved as I have not faced any major heating issues till now despite long sessions of heavy usage.

CAMERA - The back camera is fantastic and performs pretty well in all kinds of lighting conditions. Pictures are well balanced with the right dose of saturation and contrast. Camera has night mode and ultra wide features as well.

Now coming to the front camera, its a HUGE LET DOWN. Perhaps the only thing in this phone that has disappointed me is Its front camera. I found the front camera performance to be very inconsistent and borderline terrible at times specially in indoor conditions. Don't buy this one if you take too many selfies.

USER INTERFACE - Clean and crisp, without any bloatwares.
We may not get ""the Classic Oxygen OS"" anymore but it's still oxygen OS and IMO it is far better than the UI experience provided by any of it's competitors.

BUILD & DESIGN - The Nord 2T looks classy and feels premium to the core. No arguments on this one.

Overall, i am completely happy and satisfied with this phone's performance till now and I find it to be value for money at 29k!!!

I believe every phone compromises somewhere or the other in this price range, just be sure about your requirements and make a decision accordingly."
240,"Very good display quality,and performance of this phone is mind-blowing but there is only one flash light second flash light is only for show-off"
241,"Battery life is awesome, fast charging also awesome... Design just lovely....I gone through reviews before purchasing this...& Was about to my finger crossed... I was thinking for return if found heat....but it's good while compare with Google pixel 6A....which I returned after fought with customer care....May be I got the good handset....And last ....Alert switch & volume botton placed in great place...Just found good...Thanks to OnePlus...Ok price can be little less..other than ok"
242,"The phone is a masterpiece!
Camera is just too good. Display is excellent.
Yes the battery isn't the best but the 80W charges it up in almost no time."
243,Product quality and build are good. Pictures and Videos by the camera are good. Fingerprint sensor and face unlock features are fast n quick. Battery performance is good and charging of battery is very quick n super fast.
244,The product is good. Camera quality is good. Battery lasts for long time. Phone build quality is good. Good phone in this budget. Camera is little too big.
245,"Delivery was on time, even the packaging was nicely done . The camera is a disappointment. It is so huge that it ruins the overall look of the phone.
Other than that its ok"
246,Purchased this for my brother. i was a oneplus 6T user earlier for a long time that was a amazing flagship device at that time & the same vibes i am getting again for this phone. Again it will be the flagship device of this budget range phone. Amazing phone everything is is just perfect. But camera I clicked some photos don’t know why I didn’t get that old 6T wala feeling. Although it has sony lens and all. Except that every thing is just perfect
247,Got my first one+ phone. Looks are outstanding. It's quite light. Camera is superb. Even night photos are good. Battery is quite decent. Either you will get a decent lightweight phone with slim looks or go for fat one with it you can make abs. Using since morning even after 12 hours. I still have 40% battery left. Also the charger is super charger 19 to 100% in just 15 min without heating.
248, Like
249,"I didn't like this phone... I were using OnePlus when OnePlus one launched then 5 and 7t and now this Nord 2t.

Camera is main issue. If you camera centric wants to get good and crisp images so mine advise to you DON'T BUY THIS PHONE.

Heating issue and battery backup is so poor in average use..

This is from mine side"
250,"Writing this review after using phone for 5 days.
Previously I was using OnePlus 6T (6GB, 128GB)
One plus 2T is a good choise in the mid-range under 30k range. The phone is working smoothly. I am not a gamer and don't play any games but I use multiple apps. I find the phone to be handling very smoothly. I heating issue is solved with the latest update.
Some pros and cons are as under ( comparing this phone with my previous phone OnePlus 6T)
Pros- Great build quality feels premium, Great speakers, 6+ hrs battery back up, OnePlus user experience, extended 1 yr warranty at only additional Rs 700, Quick charging, smooth experience.
Cons- Average Camera, Phone receiver speaker was initially not clear, however I have find it to improve.

If you are shifting from any flagship phone to this you will find the device to be very average however this is a best option to upgrade from budget smartphone/first smartphone.
Lastly it cannot be compared with nothing phone. It comes in very different price segment. Nothing phone with charger will cost you around 40k, so pointless to compare my view.
It's a very safe phone to purchase no compromise however no surprises also. Go for it. My rating 4.2/5."
251,"I am using this phone for past 2 weeks and Yes I can recommend this phone for those people who are looking for a decent phone with no garbage (bloat) and a beautiful experience in daily usage and yaa you can do casual gaming in this phone but obviously this is not a gaming phone So, just don't hope for that level of performance and atlast battery life is just average you will receive 1 day of backup with 60hz display and with 90 hz backup will reduce.

Display-. 4/5
Camera-. 4/5
Speaker-. 5/5
Processor-. 5/5
UI-. 5/5
Battery-. 3.5/5 (with 90hz)

Overall-. 4.5/5"
252,"Play Video
 Good"
253,The phone is excellent in all terms. But only one issue is that the battery goes down very soon. It will last only one day. But the charging speed compensates it. The phone is overall good
254,"Fingerprint is good, battery fast drain, camera quality very good, sometime my phone was little hang, i can't imagine this thing for one plus."
255,"If you're that guy who's confused between IQOO Neo 6 vs NOTE 2T vs Nothing Phone 1 vs Reno 8 then you should definitely go for this phone. Following conditions applied:
1. If you choose Quality with little here and there with Performance.
2. Not a serious gamer and need phone with optimal software and user experience.
3. Need a standard size phone viz is single handed and robust.
4. one who's lot more defined towards brand value.
This phone performs way better than all the reviewers told in their videos. Trust me guys I've seen no heating issues, no lag, 90Hz performs very well and no big deal of getting 120Hz. This panel works well.
Charging Experience is very good.
Phone feels sturdy and premium.
I was earlier going for Nothing and was confused between Nord 2t IQOO Neo 6 and this phone yet I chose this considering a balanced package at this price point.
One plus never let you down. It is just that technology is getting saturated and people are like checking the antutu scores just for the gaming but if you're a casual user and need optimal software experience with ZERO bloatware this this is the perfect choice in this segment. Go for it......No regrets at all and don't look at the negative comments in the reviews. Plus that alert slider is also a premium feature."
256,"Review writing after 15 days use. No need to think you can purchase. Simple super for heavy user also. Bcoz battery charge to fast with in 30 mins

268,"Writing with the one plus Nord 2t I've purchased it on around 10th July and used till date
Everything in this phone is worth buying you'll not regret attaching the night mode photo as the real photo was fully dark but the night mode made it so bright"
269,"Camera quality is completely not acceptable at this price segment.
Just for a sake they have used the Sony Lenses for Both front and back camera but the optimization is very poor.
Front camera is very blurry while taking images even in outdoor lighting condition.
I would recommend people not to buy for this Phone if camera is most priority.
OnePlus is not up to the mark like previous generation Phones."
270,"Fingerprint reader is quite fast, battery is good and camera quality is cool"
271,3.5 mm jack is not available. Rest everything is OK

No heating problem for me."
273,Battery is not good..
274,"Very happy about the phone. Fast charger is awesome. Very good in hand feel. They give cover and screen guard and important charger in the box itself.

Wireless charging is the only thing missing"
275,Phone is very well but battery backup is not good
276,Good phone for a daily use activity. Camera is very good and the battery life is preety decent.
277,Jis speed main phone charge hta hai almost utni hi speed main discharge ho jaata hai. Front camera is not that fine....else other features are good.....looks and finishing of the phone is really classy....

Awesome dual speaker quality....
Brilliant camera quality..(basically for those who love photography)
Smooth gaming..
And most important very fast changing with 80W charger...."
283,"Upgraded from a Samsung phone and got this phone in a very good exchange deal.
Based on one-day usage of the phone, I find its look and feel is premium, heavier than my Samsung though with a good processor and battery charging that works like a charm. The biggest cons are it gets heated and the battery gets drained quickly although the fast charging makes up for it. Camera, Unlock feature, Alert slider, Lifestyle modes, etc. are all good enough but the phone is little pricey compared to others in this range for its specifications. There seems to be a software bug in the closing all apps feature which sometimes won't kill the current app. I hope with software updates the heating, battery drain, etc issues get resolved.
Will update review on usage."
284,One of the best phone in oneplus series touch is very good nice battery life excellent camera in nut shell it’s a value for money
285,"Pros- 1.Good Design
2.Average Camera
3.Good Processor
4.Superb Speakers

Cons- 1.Quick battery drain
2.Heating problems
3.90 Hz low refresh rate
4.Less Features"
286,"Overall Phone is good with light weight, well designed, call clarity, ample storage space.
It would be better to have LED indication for miss calls, reminders, messages etc. Battery life should be improved."
287,"The first thing is it's a very gud balanced mobile.
1. Good cameras, best display 90hz (there's no
difference btw 90hz and 120hz,it's a trick).
2. Battery will easily sufficient for 1 day and fast
charging was amazing,takes roughly 20-25
mins
3.dimensity 1300 it's good in daily usable apps,
very good ram management.
4. In-display fingerprint sensor was very fast.
5. Especially the Oxygen OS was still interesting
and many new features were included.
6. Android 12 and OS 12.1 was impressive no
blotware and clean UI.
7. Stereo speakers was rocking, loudest, balance
8. Design was attractive, and it's absolutely light
weight, in hand feel was classy and premium.
9. Many 5g bands, NFC, 4g+, very good UI.

And coming to disappointments
1. If your prior use is gamming this mobile was
not preferable there are other mobiles for
that like iqoo...etc
2. Daily 1-2 hrs gamming was good but some
heating we can see like 40*c.
3. At this price we expect snapdragon but this is
also good.

Finally, if u love OnePlus brand, don't believe any reviews. Go for ONEPLUS NORD 2T 5g."
288,Look wise it's awesome but there is some battery backup issue because it's automatically draining when no use....Rear camera is awesome but again front is average..... performance on games and all is good

It's lyk more than 3weeks I am using this phone. After doing so much of research and all I choose this phone as it's the first phone with my own earned money ??

So 1st the LOOK...No need to comment. Look is just wowww. And that jade green colour is just unique typ of CLR to have.

WEIGHT wise it's not so heavy not so light type of phone. U gonna have a good in hand experience.

CAMERA I have attached the pictures of daylight in the evening and in the night also. So u guys can judge by looking at those pictures. PS- those pictures without edits.

STORAGE HUGeeee storage. 12+256gb! It's been 3wk and I have been able to fulfill only the 13% of storage. Though I feel if they could have provided the external storage it could have been complete storage pack.

SPEED the touch performance of the phone is pretty good. It takes less time while switching from a app to another."

Super display,super Sound
And obviously super oneplus branding."

But battery drains slightly faster."

Camera picture quality is also good.
AI feature further enhances the picture.
Phone performance is quite good.
Also, there is a provision to further expand the RAM upto 7 GB if we have enough storage space.
Overall great phone and value for money."

518,Best????
519,"The camera is a bit weird, I am posting two pictures taken by it. At times it captures DSLR quality photos and other times it just can't do it. But apart from that all other aspects of the phone are quite amazing. I don't play games on my mobile phone so, I have no idea about it but anyway, if this helps you then that's all that matters.

Pros:
Picture quality 5/5
Battery 4/5
Performance 5/5
UI 5/5

Cons
Minor heat issue when you spend more time or keep on hotspot for longer time.

Oneplus is a brand

Just go for it without thinking"

828,"Pleaseeeee don't buy this Phone at all..
Its totally wastage of Rs. 29K specially if you are Camera lover or thinking about to buy this for any photo or video purpose then it's a humble request for your sake..
1. Back camera is Normally good

2. Rear 50 MP camera is just only for name also you can't Zoom in when you are using 50 MP option.

3. Front camera is like VGA or 2 MP cheap camera.. its 32 MP but i think OnePlus has forgot to add 30 MP and just add a simple 2 MP front camera. I didn't saw this kind of cheap camera Quality.

4. OnePlus says Supervooc 80 Watts charger but this is also only for Name it is not any Supervooc power it's like any other fast charger

5. Battery backup is too much bad as it charges fast and battery also get drained fast..

I wanted to post review earlier but Amazon had blocked review option Today review option started so i am posting a genuine and personal review rest you can take a try if you think i am telling lies"

910,
911,"I will mention some key features which will help in selection/ rejection:

Over hyped with respect to performance

Over priced

Slow to read and react

Phone hangs many a times

Internal errors like sometimes phone keeps on ringing without any call and one cannot do anything else than wait.

Cannot withstand with multiple working apps at a time

Speaker is not very good, sound quality is ok but i have observed performance depleation in less than a months time

Initially battery life was good but within a week's time, it start showing signs of a poor battery. 80 way charger, chargers phone in no time but it also drains in no time. Poor battery.

Colours and overall appearance is ok."
912,
913,Just awesome
914,??
915,"Camera quality is decent.
Build quality is good.
Dont expect highend camera quality"
916,Nice mobile must buy like it ...
917,
918,"Read other comments for pros and cons.
Major con of this phone is
Low light front cam photos are the worst. So if someone is taking the phone for selfie then go for oppo or vivo in this range.
Otherwise everything is fine."
919,"The product is not at all worthy. I purchased it for 34k and after getting it delivered I found the lagging issue then tried to contact Amazon care after hectic tries I got connected to an agent and he arranged a technician for an inspection of the mobile,. The so called technician called me and asked me to download an app for his testing purpose so I downloaded but not registered but I said I have done with registration then he lies that everything is working good in the phone without visiting me physically. Then again I tried to reach out Amazon regarding the issue then they said i can reach out the brand service, bloody how come I go for a warranty by paying 34k for a new product and begging for solution. So finally they arranged a replacement for mobile it's been 3 days since I didn't receive any call from the concerned department. They simply reschedule delivery for 3 times and says that its you who didn't answer phone call actually they won't call you to replace."
920,Awesome phone.
921,"Almost nothing is good about this phone. O2 operating system is now CO2 Operating system. Automatic brightness is a feature from decades earlier yet you've still managed to mess this up. Again battery optimisation is the worst, Around 4 hours screen time. Camera is always over saturated and iso is always on the higher side. Background apps get closed so fast so multitasking is a no no, it straggles to keep up. System hang issue faced even in Android 12. Dimensity 1200 is better than Dimensity 1300, it's deceiving. Why did we pay around 29k for this phone? I mean 4k 60fps is now 4k 30fps? Really? One last recommendation, WORK ON THE SOFTWARE. This is not a stable software."
922,Overall 5/5 Rating
923,"Using since 3 days no issue till now
Pros
Good camera
Night mode is also working well
Charging is super fast as mentioned in specs
Display is super
CONS
Battery is draining so fast
Else seems to be good till now"
924,
925,Only camera clarity excite you...Battery lasting time is less than one day... everyday at the end of the day you need to charge the battery ...any additional features are useless when your battery backup doesn't support... overall money waste on this mobile.
926, Awesome phone
927,"12GB 1+ is awesome phone, it's real fast and charger is just wow. Camera and display could have been better but not disappointing. Face camera it's real quick and accurate"
928,"10 to 15 days using mobile After I faced many problems
Heavy heavy charging time and also When I am using mobile data
Automatically typing
My expectations not reached this phone
Performance is not good"
929,"My phone is barely 10 days old. I play a game called pyramid solitaire ...the battery drains out almost as fast as it charges. I charge atleast 2 times a day and on Sunday 3.

The phone fell from my hand hardly 2feet and the screen cracked...really unsturdy . I previously used a vivo v11 pro for 4 years...it was tough and sturdy...despite slips and falls it never cracked and remained new and shiny. So much for Gorilla coming glass on this phone . It heats up as well"
930,It's totally flop product from one+ not good battery backup also camera quality is ok ok...not best also not gameing Mobile only purchase due to one+ brand.... please choose other one in this price range... best phone are available in this price range.
931,"Hi

I want to share a my review for the recent purchase of ""Oneplus nord 2t 5G"" phone [Buggy phone]

1. Close all app is not working it just closing the one screen not all.
2. Fingerprint sensor is sometimes not taking in a once doesn't matter fingers are clean and not dusted.

3. Gallary view - No flexibility to see the media by date wise

3. Hide media is not secured - once I have hided and unhided then again I cant hide the same

4. Front selfie - Not a bug but user experience is poor because of the corncer camera the selfie doesnt looks good.

Otherwise Camera, System performance, Battery life and Fast charging these are good."
932,Spent 33K on a phone on which I can't rely on. Battery does not even last 12 hours. Really disappointed with OnePlus.
933,The best oneplus mobile in this price segment affordable for all. Pretty much satisfied with the product as it can easily handle the work of a day or two!
934,
935, In this price it's the best smartphone ??
936, Very good camera
937,"It's been 4 days using the mobile and it's getting too much slow while using it. And getting heats up while watching the videos or playing the games don't know what to do with the product. Even I'm trying to return the product the #Amazon executives were not responding at all. Really got hurt with the assistance of #Amazon people.

Please try to resolve my issue at the earliest dear Amazon"
938,"Battery drains really fast without even using the phone it can drop upto 10-15% at night time and while in day time even inside your pocket with all the background activities off it can drain 3-4% on it's own.
Other than the battery issue,the phone is perfect, great camera, it's a bit small phone though but comfortable to hold,and UI is super smooth,"
939,"The overall performance is fine but the touch of the phone is little sloppy, sometimes i have to touch twice to initiate a command. The camera is quite good.
Another flaw i found was the heating problem the heating will really bother you if you are a gamer. I'm not really satisfied with the phone as it comes with a 30k price tag"
940,"I would prefer poco x4 pro over this one. Battery drains very quickly, overnight drains up to 10%. Camera is not good. At this price point it's not worth buying this mobile"

Bugs need to be removed.

947, Good phone value for money camera is the best ????
948,"I like the speed, touch response, battery and charging time."
949,I will say that I am happy with this phone when I saw the heating problem in the review I was worried but this is not my case. The camera is the best. saturation as well as naturally it does not smooth out the picture which is really good. It looks like a premium phone. One thing is the lack of earphone aux port. May be I bought the phone after a long time but I am someone who uses aux as I usually forget to charge with BT earphones.
950,Battery life and camera quality is very poor
951,"From launching one phone in a year to every month, its quality is getting deteriorated. Was using one plus 7 previously, screen quality is good camera needs improvement otherwise all features are good"
952,In camera Sensor is not working properly in camera glass face problem in recording Videos
953,Mobile is not worth 29000 Rs. Camera quality is ridiculous. I am regretting trusting online feedback.
954,Battery back up is less
955,"Don't know why thy relaunch this when Nord 2 was thr...thy stop selling Nord 2 suddenly.
Too much weight...looks like holding small brick in hand...you can't hold phone in hand more then ten min.
Camera is good but not excellent...not good at all in low light.
As campare to other pH in this range looks like paid more unnecessary.
Not expected from OnePlus
I would suggest don't buy just explore other option aswell."
956,Poor battery quality and long distance photos with rear camera has low clearity. Think before buying.
957,Everything is fine but battery charging ends very quickly
958,Calling icon not disappearing even after the call is disconnected. Battery draining too fast.
959,"One of the worst phone.... overpriced
.. I am not happy with my purchase..no return option only replacement....if possible I want to return it n I want my refund....I ve totally wasted rs 27500...
My 6year old phone was much better thn this brand new one plus nord2t
My honest review after 7th day of using this phone
1) Vibration intensity is very low even in High intensity mode...many times I missed my important calls..
2) No Led light incidator..
3) Alert Slider works even when your phone locked.. anybody can changes the settings to vibrate ring n silent...one of the most drawback no use of alert slider....
4)After clicking close all button still it not closes all the tabs
5) Every time i record phone call Sounds were coming your phone is being recorded....
6) system Update consume lots of space n data why brand new phone requires so much of system Updates...
I would recommend not to buy one plus Nord 2T ...Full waste of money....i request Amazon please make return option available 4 me n refund my money......."
960,Poor quality images
961,Battery Backup is very very very low and sometimes Fingerprint sensor also doesn't work.
962,Bettry backup not good camera not good I think I have mistake for buy One plus node 2T
963,"everything is below average even if you are buying than buy this from OnePlus website
you will get option of extended warranty and protection plan
for nord2t you can't purchase from OnePlus care app.
1.display average
2.camera average
just the brand name that's also now confused where they are going.
ui is mix of realme,oppo mostly same with different themes.
any under 23k are better than this overpriced phone"
964,Device heats up even on minimal usage. When streaming video on YouTube or other platforms it abruptly pauses n resumes only when the device is restarted. Disappointed with the stability of the back camera whilst recording video. Seriosuly disappointed with one plus
965,Screen had a row of damaged pixels. The damaged row was flickering so it was hard to tell weather the damage was permanent or due to software or driver issues. OnePlus needs to take a good hard look at quality control.
966,I don't like this product because within a month phone is going hang and processor work very slow
967,"Battery ?? not charged with in 15minutes as described,it's take one hour time to full charge..."
968,Worst
969,"the battery backup of this mobile phone is very poor , its drain too fast , i have to charge norde 2t 5g, two times per day.. also i didnt like the front camera much but the back camera was the osm ,
i will not suggest any one to buy it ... in that much price ... not worth it"
970,"Very worst Phone on my view becoz before completing of one month, display didn't working....
After that went to service centre in Patna and they checked my mobile and said the parts is available 15-20 days.. I went there after 22days ..They told me parts are not available...
and they took me one week more time..
So my point of view Very worst mobile which I experienced and very very worst service by One Plus...

I want to ask Amazon and Oneplus company provide me one year warranty...
And before one month not completing your display is not working and in service centre almost one month completing...
I'm not received my mobile in working condition, So who gives me one month extra warranty??
If warranty ends in 31-08-2022 and my mobile didn't from 31-08-22 night and another day you went to service centre they didn't give you extand single day warranty...
And Oneplus take one month to providing service ...
So guys think about it and take those mobile which is better service provider in your area.."
971,"Only 30% charged in 15 minutes. Service center staff in New Delhi charged their phones with the provided charger and their phones also charged slowly. Charging the phones with an alternative charger worked fine. So, as per the tests, they advised that there is an issue with the provided charger.

However, OnePlus said they need to confiscate BOTH the phone and the charger even though the issue is with the charger with NO timeline on when the phone will be returned!

In other words, OnePlus checked and concluded that a faulty charger was delivered but are finding excuses not to replace it. Oneplus phone support was worse.

I found that others have faced similar issues with OnePlus.

Buying a OnePlus phone is like buying a lottery ticket: either you receive a good device or OnePlus will refuse to place the faulty product."

978,very bad phone in this range. Program shuts down automatically. phone gets switch off while on call. battery life very bad only using 1-2hr for whatsapp and insta battery will drop.

1. Any application is killed if you open another application. And it happens in case of if you see any OTP in email as well
2. Sometimes sound resonates
3. Touch is not working properly. If you click on any icon, image thumb it redirects to different image. I see this in WhatsApp. Suppose if I reply on any status of Multiple status of my friend and then I click reply in chat, the same status is not redirected, a different status is visible to me.
4. Battery is not good as they mentioned."

a classy budget phone with a very good back and front camera

Perfectly fits your hand, it's shorter than usual screen size makes it extremely handy

Cons

Heating problem is there while charging

1215,"I bought this phone as a gift for my mother. Very disappointed with this phone. When my mother unboxed the phone and switched it on there is a small red dot on the right middle of the phone which then appeared to get more bigger and the display became more dim and dark. It was a sign of explosion, my mother soon unplugged the phone from the socket before it got exploded. Amazon customer service is also poor as they only allowed me for a replaced instead of refund. I believe all the more version has same issues. Thanks"
1216," My first one plus phone awesome camera
Nice Charging speed
Good video stabilization
Cons
No 4k 60fps
Second flash light not working"
1217,"Contacts are available in the mobile, but contacts searching is not working. (oneplus nord 2t)

1218,"Unsatisfactory handset.

Sound problem with the divice. And performance are also not good.

Not recommended the device at all ."
1219,"I was in love with Oneplus brand and from last 3 years I was using oneplus6 and now decided to upgrade my phone which now I think is the biggest mistake. The battery backup is fine as i m not much into gaming but the major issue is the front camera.. Even my old smartphone (oneplus6) is able to click quality pictures then the new nord2t..

I m looking for a refund but OnePlus care team is also not assisting me properly..

Hence, its a shame

Other Aspects to worry -

Sound Quality too poor

Automatic Call Recording not available

Phone heats up sometimes"
1220,Worst association from OnePlus. Such a poor interface. It's 12 gb ram still it get struck. Please don't go with Nord. Such a worst operating system. Go with only oneplus only.
1221,"What is there in this mobile, the price is high, I think this phone does not have a 3.5 mm jack to connect headphones"
1222,It's not oxygen os. It's Android phone. Camera is world's worst camera. No do not buy guys. You ll regret it. There's no return policy
1223,"Build Quality is not upto OnePlus legacy, screen broken on very first day due just slip of hand, doubt on glass quality , I have dropped my oneplus8 100times but still safe"
1224,Mobile 30 min vedio dekhne bad hang hota hai.battary performance low hai and camera quality low hai. Vedio and you dekhne PE hang hota hai.
1225,Hot and not good quality product
1226,"Worst phone I ever used. Hanging multiple times. Cheap grade build quality. Not expected from Oneplus.

Not suggest for buy."
1227,"Wrist phone ever from one+
Automatically switch to voice call from video call
Hang some time
Don't buy this 0"
1228,Product may good but Amazon service is useless better try any other app they treat customer as beggars usless service
1229,"Charging is the worst part this and services are so bad
Service centre of Agra behaved very bad with me"
1230,"Bought the best configuration of one plus nord2 with 12 gb ram thought it will be the best but sadly it hangs not even 6 month completed.
Screen flickers.
I have no option but to keep this phone.
And camera it is not what it use to be.
Very upset with product quality."
1231,
1232,"I brought this OnePlus Nord 2T product for regular use
OnePlus Nord 2T mobile looks premium & is light weight, speakers are loud , display & charging speed are good.
It takes around 43 minutes to charge from 5% - 100% when the device is on.
When the device is in switched off mode it charges from 4% - 100% within 32 minutes.

Must say Battery life is poor. I'm only able to get 9 - 6 of charge i.e 9 hours of battery life normal use.

Camera are decent enough but it could have been little better.

Display is good so as with in display Fingerprint scanner.

Sometimes i.e. at random intervals phone heats up a lot also
Noticed many a times during 12-15+ minutes of call

To best of my knowledge & experience with 6 days of use with OnePlus Nord 2T I can tell this phone could be amazing for normal use only if Battery life is improved.

Requesting OnePlus to improve Battery life what is the point of fast charging when it can't last for atleast 12 hours with regular/ moderate use.

Basic purpose of phone is is defeated when the battery doesn't last long... How much battery optimization do you want your customer to perform ?

If only battery optimization is the solution then what is the purpose of buying OnePlus mobile over other brands in the market?

Just think OnePlus. Why choose OnePlus over other?"
1233,"One Plus ne Utna Haga, Jitna Haga Jaa Sakta tha, Par Ek Design mein Kitna haga jaa sakta tha ? :')"
1234,"Apps are loading too slowly, camera is too worst, after ending the call the volte icon is remains for sometime.."
1235,I used just 1hr the camera ?? worst clarity compared to mi basic mobile good than this phone and back camera also not satisfied I disappointed with front cam
1236,"I got this phone recently. Only 1 flash light is working. Is it normal? Pl let know.

Wange to confirm this aspect."
1237,"This review is not regarding phone.It is regarding Amazon Prime delivery service.It was awful and Shit Amazon Prime delivery experience. I ordered this phone on 6th Aug and it suppose to deliver on 7th Aug.It arrive at my location at 3.30 PM on 7th Aug due late delivery or Amazon technical issue that was not delivered to me on that day. Further lots of fake promises are given on next of phone delivery. On 8th Aug i didn't received product.It is a failure to tech giants like Amazon to not to deliver a product on time and specially in metropolitan city like Mumbai.Then i have a question to Amazon how organization is going to spread in rural areas of India.It was absolutely frustrating experience with so called tech giant and their Prime Membership shit. Such kind of shit is not tolerable, i contacted to customer care service team several times, team was helpless. If organization is not able to deliver a product on specified time and day in metropolitan city, then how prime membership claims guaranteed delivery shit.This claim is misleading.
Not thanking you for such terrible experience Amazon."
1238,I have OnePlus 7 and I compared camera quality with it by taking same video and found Nord 2t is no way close to OnePlus 7. Front camera is very pathetic.
1239,"All phones under the OnePlus 30K are rubbish.
Better not to take it without review.
The quality is not good, the camera is too tired, and the front camera is so crap."
1240,Battery backup wrost camera it's fine then slim mobile It's ok fine will give rate don't buy mobile this model
1241,"Play Video
 Front and Back Camara not Good. Don't buy this phone ever. Both camara is not good comparison of other OnePlus phones. 32MP Camara is like 2MP Camara and 50 Megapixel like 5MP. Also amazon not return and replace my item because inspection service agent didn't submit correct report about the camara."
1242,"Best flagship camera compare with any good mobiles out there
superb quality night photos were best
Performace was buttery smooth with dimensity 1200 especially when gaming i play freefire,bgmi, codm

Battery is Excellent in one charge even after heavy usage it lasts for 8to 10 hour

Multitasking is awesome with expandable RAM

Must buy product in this price range"
1243,"Hi Amazon,

since when you Amazon started doing the online electronic faluty product related scams ? really pathetic exprice from amazon. Your so called apps decides whether actual mobile, adaptor is faulty or not form that dignosis report you are canceling the actual product replacement request.
if so i guess all amazon customer needs to learn the best lession from this is that electronic product should be purchased from Shops only.."
1244,
1245,"The performance is so smooth and fast.
I had good experience with the OnePlus Nord 2t.
Camera quality is awesome.
I shot 960 fps slow motion videos.
It just greatful for me ."
1246,I have been using OnePlus for last 3 years but was looking for a change. I was confused between Nothing Phone 1 and Nord 2T. i ended up buying Nord 2T being OnePlus loyalist and am very happy with the decision - OnePlus delivered on my expectation.
1247,Camera quality is worst in this range. If u r a camera lover don't buy
1248,Backside looks sucks. Battery life is good not best and not valuable for money. One plus now sucks after One plus 8T.
1249,All good ??
1250,"I dont know what is happening after paying this much amount , new mobile is getting hang, over heat, some ott apps stuck suddenly, network issue. I made a wrong choice. Worst mobile ever."

1254,VERY GOOD
1255,Finger print sensor work slow and fon is great camera battery charging great awesome nice g o o d i
1256,It is smooth and does it work as per its processor and the given features. The look and feel of this model is having the Oneplus core Signature built value. Overall a nice phone.
1257,"Honestly it is one of the best phone I have ever used. We all know One plus is known for its brand and quality and this model stands a chance for that.

Pros:

Beautiful finishing
50 mp camera with 20x zoom
80 w super charger - My device charges from 0 to 100 in 29 minutes
1300 Chipset
Full Amoled Display
Android 12
Gorilla Glass 5

Cons

Battery is just 4500 mAh. Battery trains fast which you are playing heavy games such as PUBG

OVER-ALL it's an amazing phone at this price range. You should give it a try. Go for 8 gb Ram and that's sufficient for heave gamers as well."
1258,"Camera quality is completely not acceptable at this price segment.
Just for a sake they have used the Sony Lenses for Both front and back camera but the optimization is very poor.
Front camera is very blurry while taking images even in outdoor lighting condition.
I would recommend people not to buy for this Phone if camera is most priority.
OnePlus is not up to the mark like previous generation Phones."
1259,average
1260,"Best Camera

Easy grip in one hand"
1261,"Camera quality of this phone is adorable, speed of processor is too fast so you won't face any performance issue. Build quality is also good. If you are Looking for a good feature phone is price range of 30K you have to consider it."

1263,"So far I found the phone to be really good. Charging is super fast, phone is smooth & fast, camera is great, speakers gives a good output too. I also like the back finish. Will update further if I find some issues."
1264,"Good phone in this price range. Best processor, decent camera, super fast charging and good battery life. All in all a good deal. Would recommend to buy this phone for under 30k price segment"

1275,"Good phone in this price range. Best processor, decent camera, super fast charging and good battery life. All in all a good deal. Would recommend to buy this phone for under 30k price segment"
1276,If u are going to spend 28000 then blindly go for this android experience is great camera is also good. Screen brightness could be more. There is no such heating problem while downloading heavy files 80-90 gb phone do get little heat but that is ok. Sound is amazing. Most interesting part is charging speed that is super fast I always try to charge phone up to 95% not above that ( this will increase battery life of the phone).
1277,Every thing is perfect
1278,"The best phone in this segment and also the branding is too important.so your must go for it..
